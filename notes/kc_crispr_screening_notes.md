# Objectives
1. Learn how to write in markdown 
2. Read up on CRISPR-Cas9 basic biology and its application as a high-throughput screening tool
3. Version control your notes using git/github

# Instructions
- You can use this document as an example template for how to write in markdown format (this document is written in markdown)
  - Go to https://github.com/kychen37/rasilab_spelman_2023/tree/main#markdown for what markdown is and why we use it
  - Learn some of the basic formatting that is commonly used in markdown, for example:
    - bullet points (dashes -)
    - bold (**bold**)
    - italic (_italic_)
    - headers (use # at the very front of the line)
- Once you feel more familiar with markdown, go to the [CRISPR_biology_resources.md](https://github.com/kychen37/rasilab_spelman_2023/blob/main/learning_resources/CRISPR_biology_resources.md) document and go through the various links at your own pace
- As you go through the various resources, take notes as you normally would using markdown format
- Save your notes in markdown format in the "notes" directory with the file name "initials_crispr_screening_notes.md" (with your initials instead of the word 'initials')
- Feel free to ask me any questions that arise at any point in this process!
