# Objectives
1. Learn how to write in markdown 
2. Read up on CRISPR-Cas9 basic biology and its application as a high-throughput screening tool
3. Version control your notes using git/github

# Instructions
- You can use this document as an example template for how to write in markdown format (this document is written in markdown)
  - Go to https://github.com/kychen37/rasilab_spelman_2023/tree/main#markdown for what markdown is and why we use it
  - Learn some of the basic formatting that is commonly used in markdown, for example:
    - bullet points (dashes -)
    - bold (**bold**)
    - italic (_italic_)
    - headers (use # at the very front of the line)
- Once you feel more familiar with markdown, go to the [CRISPR_biology_resources.md](https://github.com/kychen37/rasilab_spelman_2023/blob/main/learning_resources/CRISPR_biology_resources.md) document and go through the various links at your own pace
- As you go through the various resources, take notes as you normally would using markdown format
- Save your notes in markdown format in the "notes" directory with the file name "initials_crispr_screening_notes.md" (with your initials instead of the word 'initials')
- Feel free to ask me any questions that arise at any point in this process!

# notes
- (**CRISPR 101 Ted Talk**)
-   a method scientists use to edit DNA, and genes within viruses, embryos, adult cells and living species
-  crispr locus keeps a copy of previous viruses  
-   introduction of double stranded DNA cuts,ang trigger cells to prepare rejuvination
-   technology is being used on mice to disrupt genes in specific areas, such as color within mice
-   can also be used in humans for enhancement or to create designer humans
-   consider theraputic and non theraputic results, also consider ethical aproach to this technique in humans
- (**What is RISPR-Cas9**)
-   allows for genetic manipulation
-   DNA mutation in enzyme Cas9, and RNA specifically gRNA that is pre-designed, and later binds to DNA sequence
-   RNA is designed to bind to a specific site within the DNA, then the cell will recognise that the DNA is damaged and attempt to repair. the also sometimes use DNA repair machinery to introduce changes more than one gene in the genome
-   This is a potential treatment method for various medical conditions such as cancer, hepratits B and high cholesterol
- (**Khan Academy video: CRISPR Cas-9**)
-   virus insert its DNA into other cells, and the cells read the genetic information as if it were thier, alowing the virus to continue to replicate and eventually take over the body
-   cas genes are places in the middle of the DNA, and then hunt for complimentary DNA strands
-   can be used to assist countries who suffer from mal nutrition, and can now cut DNA in areas that were previously inaccesible.
-   CRISPR-cas-9 is the most acurate, can only be used with reognized PAM sequences.    
-   (**CRISPR-Cas9 Screening Libraries**)
-   use gRNA for maximm knockout efficency without comporomising specificity, therefor it is high yeild
