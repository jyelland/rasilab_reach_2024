# Markdown
- Markdown is a markup language to add formatting elelments to tex documents.
- To make a heading "#"
- To make a subheading "##"
- Easy for creating websites, taking notes, and produce print-ready documents
    - can also good for book writing, presentaions, email messages, and collaboration
- Dilinger - is a Markdown editor like VSCode
- Markdown file (.md or .markdown) converts to the application then HTML then renderend output
- "flavors" - variants of Markdown
    - analogy of US Eglish vs London English. Same language different dialect.
## Markdown Tutorial
- Italics _text_
- Bold **text**
- Heading "#", More "#" smaller the heading
- Link "[Name of Link](Link)"
- Images "! [Alternative Name](Link)c
- Blockquotes " >"Quote" "
- List 
    * Item 1
        * Sub Item
    * Item 2
- List
    1. Item 1
    2. Item 2

# What is CRISPR-Cas9?
## Jennifer Doudna's Ted Talk
- Doudna purpose of creating CRISPR was to invent technology for **editing genomes**
- Changes to genetic cells to cure genetic dieases
- Cas9 is a specific protein that cuts the DNA to change specific infected part on DNA
- Stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats 
- Allows the cell to keep track of infection..."genetic vaccination card"
- **Trigger** cells to repair breaks in DNA at the points near or at the mutation
- Still some complications due to unintened effects but when it happend Doudna believs that it will benefit human health in years to come
- Enhancement for genetic change... "designer humans"
## YourGenome
- Edits parts of the genome by removing, adding, or alterniting section of DNA
- CRISPR is benefical because it is a simple and precise way of genetic manipulation
- Cas9 (enzyme) acts as a "molecular scissor"
- gRNA (guide RNA) guides the enzyme to the right part of the mutated genome
- Makes a cut across both strands
- Process of CRISPR
1. gRNA binds to trageted site
2. Cas9 enzyme binds to gRNA
3. Cas9 cuts
4. Cut is repaired introducing new mutation
- CRISPR recognises and defends aganist virus next time it attacks
- Problem: potential for gRNA to bind somewhere else on sequence rather than the targeted spot which could introdue a mutation to a wrong location
## Khan Academy
- Genetic Engerineering
- Each of the sequences are called spacers, special proteins will find and squash it
- crRNA replaces mutated RNA and tracRNA combines with crRNA because of Cas9 
- Zinc Finger Nucleases and Talens are more complicatd and takes more time than CRISPR
- CRISPR can only edit DNA next to PAM (prodce baser adjacent motifs) sequences
