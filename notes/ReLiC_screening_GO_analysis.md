**CiBER-seq dissects genetic networks by quantitative CRISPRi profiling of expression phenotypes**
- CiBER-seq is a useful tool for understanding how cells make decisions about gene expression and can help uncover the networks of genes involved in protien-making machinery
- barcode system that help measure the effects of each gene change
- different genes had different effects on the cells
    - discovered how certain genes control the production of proteins and how other genes are involved in cell division
    -  learned how cells respond to stress by looking at the activity of certain genes
- "sheds a light" on how genes work and intreact with each other
