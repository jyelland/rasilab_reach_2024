# Useful resources for understanding CRISPR and CRISPR screens

## Foundations of CRISPR Cas9 genome editing
- TED talk by the scientist who discovered CRISPR, Jennifer Doudna:

- [What is CRISPR-Cas9? â€“ YourGenome](https://www.yourgenome.org/facts/what-is-crispr-cas9/)

## CRISPR screening
- Taking the foundations of CRISPR-Cas9 technology and applying it as a high-throughput screen to obtain hundreds of thousands of measurements at once
- A very typical CRISPR screen is described here: https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/life-science/genome-editing/crispr-libraries.html (the **"Pooled CRISPR library screening workflow"** is the most relevant info)
- Our lab is designing custom CRISPR screens whose workflows differ slightly from the one described in the link
