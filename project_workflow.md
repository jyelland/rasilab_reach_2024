# Workflow and documentation

## 06/26/2023 - 06/28/2023
- Learn version control via git/github
  -	Create github and slack accounts so you can get added to the Subramaniam labâ€™s Slack group and Github groups
  -	Learn how the command line/terminal works
  -	Install github on our computers using the command line
  -	Go over the basics of version control
- Learn Markdown
- Get familiarized with VSCode, which we will use to take notes in Markdown and eventually to code Jupyter notebooks
- Read about CRISPR technologies

- Pull remote repo using command line to update your local computers (```git pull origin main```). In general, it's good practice to start the day with a ```git pull origin main``` just to make sure everything is up to date.

### Setting up our python coding environment
1. Follow the instructions in the [installing miniconda](https://github.com/kychen37/rasilab_spelman_2023/blob/main/README.md#installing-miniconda) section of our repo's README file
2. Open VSCode, and find the Extensions panel on the lefthand side
  - read more about VSCode [Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#:~:text=VS%20Code%20extensions%20let%20you,APIs%20used%20by%20VS%20Code.)
3. Search for the extension called Jupyter and download it
4. Open our rasilab_spelman_2023 folder in VSCode, and work through the python tutorials located in the ```code``` directory (see below for details)
  - If VSCode asks you to download other extensions, go ahead and install them (e.g., I think IPykernel will be one of the extensions that's needed)

### Python tutorials
- Do the tutorials located in our ```code``` folder in order:
  1. Jupyter_and_Python_Basics.ipynb
    - In the upper right corner of each notebook, click on "Select Kernel" -> "Python Environments" -> and select "(base) miniconda3/bin/python" 
  2. python_tutorial.ipynb
      - Note: Where the notebook says **Exercise**, complete the code chunk with your own code (it may contain some code already to get you started)  
- Optional tutorials:
  1. If interested, you can delve deeper into python functions with: python_functions_intro.ipynb -> procedural_programming_in_python.ipynb
