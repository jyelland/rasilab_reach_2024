# Workflow and documentation

## 06/26/2023 - 06/28/2023

- Learn version control via git/github
- Learn Markdown
- Get familiarized with VSCode, which we will use to take notes in Markdown and eventually to code Jupyter notebooks
- Read about CRISPR technologies

## 06/29/2023
- Pull remote repo using command line to update your local computers (```git pull origin main```). It's good practice to start the day with a ```git pull origin main``` just to make sure everything is up to date.

### Setting up our python coding environment
- Follow the instructions in the [installing miniconda](https://github.com/kychen37/rasilab_spelman_2023/blob/main/README.md#installing-miniconda) section of our repo's README file
- In VSCode, find the Extensions panel
- Search for the extension called Jupyter and download it
- Open our rasilab_spelman_2023 folder in VSCode, and work through the python tutorials located in the ```code``` directory
  - If VSCode asks you to download other extensions, go ahead and install them

### Python tutorials
- Do the tutorials in order:
  1. Jupyter_and_Python_Basics.ipynb
    - In the upper right corner of each notebook, click on "Select Kernel" -> "Python Environments" -> select "(base) miniconda3/bin/python" 
  2. python_tutorial.ipynb
      - Note: Where the notebook says **Exercise**, complete the code chunk with your own code (it may contain some code already to get you started)  
- Optional tutorials:
  1. If interested, you can delve deeper in python functions with: python_functions_intro.ipynb -> procedural_programming_in_python.ipynb
